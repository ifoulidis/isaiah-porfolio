DecapCMS has a huge backlog of issues. Among them is the fact that the cursor will jump to the end of a paragraph when trying to edit anything, and the terrible mobile compatibility. Why use it then? First, it is very easy to install and set up. Second, if you were already getting content using FileSystem and using the Pages router in Next.js, as I was, then you don't have to change anything in your project or get any headaches to get going.
