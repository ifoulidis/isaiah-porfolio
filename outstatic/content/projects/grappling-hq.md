## Overview

Grappling HQ is a Brazilian jiu-jitsu gym in Tauranga. I enjoy grappling there on occasion, so when I saw that the owner, Chris, did not have much of a website, I offered my services, which he has exchanged for some free training.

First, I had Chris answer some questions about style and send me some examples of other jiu-jitsu websites he liked so I could get a feel for what he was after. He was also able to give me recommended fonts and colours based on the logo from the graphic designer.

After deploying a draft on a Vercel subdomain that he really liked, I sent him a list of further content that I would need from him and instructions so that we could transfer his domain and connect his email account, etc. He requested a couple of style changes to match what he had in mind. The project was then completed with minimal hassle, and we're both satisfied with the result!
